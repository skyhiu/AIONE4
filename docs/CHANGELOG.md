# Changelog

## 4.0.0-alpha.1 — T0: repository, CI, first window (2026-10-12)

- New project: Tauri 2.12 (Rust 1.91.1) + Svelte 5 + strict TypeScript + Vite 8.
- Fullscreen borderless window showing "AIONE 4" and the version on a plain dark background; shown after the first frame (no white flash).
- Single instance (a second start focuses the running one); restart waits for the old instance to exit (`--wait-for-pid`).
- Foreground at every start with logged fallbacks (direct, attach-thread-input, input-event, topmost-pulse); an 8 s start-up guard; never left topmost.
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIONE4\` with `Logs\aione.log` and `Logs\lifecycle.log`.
- One-time offer to copy the WPF data folder (read only); counts with the loader's rule; source checked unchanged.
- Controller input (XInput, Guide included) read in the core; T0-only input readout for controller, keyboard and mouse.
- `--autostart=on|off` (temporary until the Settings toggle in T3).
- CI on Windows with pinned actions and tools; pre-release with the portable zip and UI screenshots.
